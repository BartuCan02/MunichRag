## Munich

Munich [a] is the capital and most populous city of Bavaria, Germany. As of 30  November  2024,  its  population  was 1,604,384, [3] making  it  the  third-largest city in Germany after Berlin and Hamburg.  Munich  is  the  largest  city  in Germany that is not a state of its own.

It ranks  as  the  11th-largest  city  in  the European  Union.  The  metropolitan  area has around 3 million inhabitants, and the broader  Munich  Metropolitan  Region  is home to about 6.2 million people. [4] It  is the  third  largest  metropolitan  region  by GDP in the European Union.

Munich is located on the river Isar north of  the  Alps.  It  is  the  seat  of  the  Upper Bavarian administrative region. With 4,500 people per km 2 , Munich is Germany's most densely populated municipality.  It  is  also  the  second-largest city in the Bavarian  dialect  area  after Vienna.

The first record of Munich dates to 1158. The  city  has  played  an  important  role  in Bavarian and German history. During the Reformation, it remained a Catholic stronghold. Munich became the capital of the Kingdom  of  Bavaria  in  1806  and developed as a centre for arts, architecture, culture, and science. The House  of  Wittelsbach  ruled  until  1918, when  the  German  revolution  of  19181919 ended their reign and saw the shortlived Bavarian Soviet Republic.

In the 1920s, Munich became a centre of political movements, including the rise of the Nazi Party. The city was known as the "Capital of the Movement". During World War II, Munich was heavily bombed, but much of its historic architecture has since been restored. [5][6] After the war, the city's population  and  economy  grew  rapidly. Munich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics.

Location of Munich

<!-- image -->

Munich  is  a  major  centre  for  science, technology, finance, innovation, business, and  tourism.  It  has  a  high  standard  of living, ranking first in Germany and third worldwide  in  the  2018  Mercer  survey. [7] It  was  named  the  world's  most  liveable city by Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. [8] Munich is among the most expensive  German  cities  for  real  estate and  rents. [9][10] In  2023,  30.1  percent  of residents were foreigners, and 19.4 percent were German  citizens with a migration background from abroad. [11]

Munich's economy is based on high tech, automobiles, the service sector, information technology, biotechnology, engineering, and electronics. Multinational  companies  such  as  BMW, Siemens, Allianz SE, and Munich Re are headquartered  there.  The  city has two research  universities  and  many  scientific institutions. [12] Munich  is  known  for  its architecture, cultural venues, sports events, exhibitions, and the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest Volksfest . [13]

## History

## Etymology

Munich  was  a tiny 12th-century friar settlement, which was named zu den Munchen ("to the monks"). The Old High German Munche served as the base for the modern German city name München . [14]

## Prehistory

The river Isar was a prehistoric trade route and in the Bronze  Age Munich was among the largest raft ports in Europe. [15] Bronze Age settlements up to four millennia  old  have  been  discovered. [16] Evidence  of  Celtic  settlements  from  the Iron  Age  have  been  discovered  in  areas around Ramersdorf-Perlach. [17]

## Roman period

The ancient Roman road Via Julia, which connected Augsburg and Salzburg, crossed over the Isar south of Munich, at the towns of Baierbrunn and Gauting. [18] A Roman settlement north-east of Munich was  excavated  in  the  neighborhood  of Denning. [19]

## Post-Roman settlements

Starting  in  the  6th  century,  the  Baiuvarii populated  the  area  around  what  is  now modern Munich, such as in Johanneskirchen, Feldmoching, Bogenhausen and Pasing. [20][21] The  first known Christian church was built ca. 815 in Fröttmanning. [22]

## Origin of medieval town

The first medieval bridges across the river Isar  were  located  in  current  city  areas  of Munich  and  Landshut. [15] The  Duke  of Saxony and Bavaria Henry the Lion founded the town of Munich in his territory  to  control  the  salt  trade,  after having burned down the town of Föhring and its bridges over the Isar. [23] Historians date  this event  at  about  1158. [24] The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of Höxter. [25]

home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbrücke is now located. [26]

Otto  of  Freising  protested  to  his  nephew,  Emperor  Frederick  Barbarosa  (d.  1190).  However,  on  14  June  1158,  in Augsburg, the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The Augsburg Arbitration mentions the name of the location in dispute as forum apud Munichen . Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation. [27][28][29]

The  14th  June  1158  is  considered  the  official  founding  day  of  the  city  of  Munich.  Archaeological  excavations  at Marienhof Square (near Marienplatz) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels  from  the  11th  century,  which  prove  again  that  the  settlement  of  Munich  must  be  older  than  the  Augsburg Arbitration of 1158. [30][31] The old St. Peter's Church near Marienplatz is also believed to predate the founding date of the town. [32]

In  1175,  Munich  received  city  status  and  fortification.  In  1180,  after  Henry  the  Lion's  fall  from  grace  with  Emperor Frederick Barbarosa, including his trial and exile, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the Bishop of Freising. In 1240, Munich was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria.

Duke Louis IV, a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.

On 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in Munich that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town. [33]

In 1349, the Black Death ravaged Munich and Bavaria. [34]

The growth of Munich was supplemented by its location on top of a gravel bed,  where  the  Isar  branched  into  Munich  City  Streams,  which  in  turn provided power for many mills and industries within Munich.

In the 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of Gothic arts: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest Gothic church - the Frauenkirche now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.

## Capital of reunited Bavaria

When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 after a brief war against the Duchy of Landshut, Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly  influenced  by  the  court.  The  Renaissance  movement  beset Munich  and  the  Bavarian  branch  of  the  House  of  Wittelsbach  under  Duke Albrecht V who bolstered their prestige by conjuring up a lineage that reached back to classical antiquity. In 1568 Albrecht V built the Antiquarium to house the  Wittelsbach  collection  of  Greek  and  Roman  antiquities  in  the  Munich Residenz. [35] Albrecht V appointed the composer Orlando di Lasso as director of the court orchestra and tempted numerous Italian musicians to work at the Munich court, establishing Munich as a hub for late Renaissance music. [36] During the rule of Duke William V Munich began to be called the "German Rome" and William V began presenting Emperor Charlemagne as ancestor of the Wittelsbach dynasty. [37]

Duke William V further cemented the Wittelsbach rule by commissioning the Jesuit  Michaelskirche.  He  had  the  sermons  of  his  Jesuit  court  preacher Jeremias Drexel translated from Latin into German and published them to a greater  audience. [38] William  V  was  addressed  with  the  epithet  "the  Pious" and like his contemporary Wittelsbach dukes promoted himself as "father of the  land"  ( Landesvater ),  encouraged  pilgrimages  and  Marian  devotions. [39] William V had the Hofbräuhaus built in 1589. It would become the prototype for beer halls across Munich.  After  World  War  II  the  Residenze,  the Hofbräuhaus,  the  Frauenkirche,  and  the  Peterskirche  were  reconstructed  to look exactly as they did before the Nazi Party seized power in 1933. [40]

The  Catholic  League  was  founded  in  Munich  in  1609.  In  1623,  during  the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Munich became an electoral residence when Duke Maximilian I was invested with the electoral dignity, but in 1632 the city was occupied by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. [41]

In  1634  Swedish  and  Spanish  troops  advanced  on  Munich.  Maximilian  I published a plague ordinance to halt an epidemic escalation. [42] The bubonic plague nevertheless ravaged Munich and the surrounding countryside in 1634 and  1635. [43] During  the  Thirty  Years'  War (1618-1648)  troops  again converged  on  Munich  in  1647  and  precautions  were  taken,  so  as  to  avoid another epidemic. [44]

Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742. When Elector Maximilian III Joseph died in 1745, the succession empowered the Palatinate branch within the House of Wittelsbach. [45]

In 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited by Karl Theodor. The new duke was disliked  by  the  citizens  of  Munich  for  his  supposedly  enlightened  ideas.  In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford Benjamin Thompson to take up residency in Munich and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built workhouses. The Bavarian army was restructured,  with  common  soldiers  receiving  better  food  and  reassurances that they would be treated humanely by officers. [46] Munich was the largest German city to lose fortification in the 1790s. [47] In 1791 Karl Theodor and Count  Rumford  started  to  demolish  Munich's  fortifications. [48] After  1793 Munich's citizens, including house servants, carpenters, butchers, merchants, and  court  officials,  seized  the  opportunity,  building  new  houses,  stalls,  and

sheds outside the city walls. [49]

After making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became  the  capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806 with

Elector Maximillian IV Joseph becoming its first king. The state parliament (the Landtag )  and  the  new  archdiocese  of  Munich  and  Freising  were  also located in the city.

The establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly  affected  Munich. Munich became the center of a  modernizing  kingdom,  and one  of  the  king's  first  acts was the secularization of Bavaria. He had dissolved all monasteries in 1802 and once crowned,  Maximilian  Joseph generated  state  revenues  by selling off

<!-- image -->

church  lands.  While many  monasteries  were  reestablished,  Maximilian  Joseph  I  succeeded  in controlling the right to brew beer ( Braurecht ). The king handed the brewing monopoly to Munich's wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxes on  their  beer  production.  In  1807  the  king  abolished  all  ordinances  that limited the number of apprentices and journeymen a brewery could employ. Munich's  population  had  swelled  and  Munich  brewers  were  now  free  to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand. [50] In October 1810  a  beer  festival  was  held  on  the  meadows  just  outside  Munich  to commemorate the wedding of the crown prince and princess Therese of SaxeHildburghausen.  The  parades  in  regional  dress  ( Tracht ) represented  the

diversity of the kingdom. The fields are now part of the Theresienwiese and the celebrations developed into Munich's annual Oktoberfest. [51]

The Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns ( Wirtshäuser ) were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the competition among breweries. [52] In 1831 the king's government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower- ranking civil servants and soldiers. Soldiers stationed in Munich were granted a daily allowance  for  beer  in  the  early  1840s. [53] By  the  1850s  beer  had  become  essential staple food for Munich's working and lower classes. Since the Middle Ages beer had been  regarded  as  nutritious liquid  bread ( fließendes  Brot )  in  Bavaria.  But  Munich suffered from poor water sanitation and as early as the 1700s beer came to be regarded as the fifth element . Beer was essential in maintaining public health in Munich and in the mid-1840s Munich police estimated that at least 40,000 residents relied primarily on beer for their nutrition. [54]

In 1832 Peter von Hess painted the Greek War of Independence at the order of King Ludwig  I.  Ludwig  I  had  the  Königsplatz  built  in  neoclassicism  as  a  matter  of ideological choice. Leo von Klenze supervised the construction of a Propylaea between 1854 and 1862. [55]

During  the  early  to  mid-19th  century,  the  old  fortified  city  walls  of  Munich  were largely demolished due to population expansion. [56] The first  Munich railway station was built in 1839, with a line going to Augsburg in the west. By 1849 a newer Munich Central Train  Station  (München  Hauptbahnhof)  was  completed,  with  a  line  going  to Landshut and Regensburg in the north. [57][58] In  1825  Ludwig I had ascended to the

throne and commissioned leading architects such as Leo von Klenze to design a series of public museums in neoclassical style. The grand building projects of  Ludwig  I  gave  Munich  the  endearment  "Isar-Athen"  and  "Monaco  di Bavaria". [59] Between  1856  and  1861  the  court  gardener  Carl  von  Effner landscaped  the  banks  of  the  river  Isar  and  established  the Maximilian Gardens .  From 1848 the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten was published as a regional newspaper in Munich. In 1857 the construction of the Maximilianeum was begun. [60]

<!-- image -->

By the time Ludwig II became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and  focused  more  on  his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the 'fairytale king'.

The Palace of Justice in Baroque Revival style

Ludwig II tried to lure Richard Wagner to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for Munich's craft and construction industries. In 1876 Munich hosted the first  German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern Neo-Renaissance fashion that came to be the German Empire's predominant style. Munich based artists put on the German National Applied Arts Exhibition in 1888, showcasing Baroque Revival architecture and Rococo Revival designs. [61]

In  1900 Wilhelm Röntgen moved to Munich, where he was appointed as a professor of physics. In 1901 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. [62]

The  Prince  Regent  Luitpold's  reign  from  1886  to  1912  was  marked  by tremendous  artistic  and  cultural  activity  in  Munich. [63] At  the  dawn  of  the 20th century Munich  was  an epicenter for the Jugendstil movement, combining a liberal magazine culture with progressive industrial design and architecture.  The  German  art  movement  took  its  name  from  the  Munich magazine Die  Jugend ( The  Youth ). [64] Prominent  Munich  Jugendstil  artists include Hans Eduard von Berlepsch-Valendas, Otto Eckmann, [65] Margarethe von Brauchitsch, August Endell, Hermann Obrist, Wilhelm von Debschitz, [66] and Richard Riemerschmid. In 1905 two large department stores opened in Munich, the Kaufhaus Oberpollinger and the Warenhaus Hermann Tietz, both

having  been  designed  by  the  architect  Max  Littmann. [67] In  1911  the  expressionist  group  Der  Blaue  Reiter  was established in Munich. Its founding members include Gabriele Münter. [68]

## World War I to World War II

Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.

In  1916,  the  'Bayerische  Motoren  Werke'  (BMW)  produced  its  first  aircraft  engine  in  Munich. [69] The  public  limited company BMW AG was founded in 1918, with Camillo Castiglioni owning one third of the share capital. In 1922 BMW relocated its headquarters to a factory in Munich. [70]

After World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution, Ludwig III of Bavaria and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. [71] The November 1918 revolution ended the reign of the Wittelsbach in Bavaria. [72] In Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler described his political activism in Munich after November 1918 as the "Beginning of My Political Activity". Hitler called the shortlived Bavarian Soviet Republic "the rule of the Jews". [73] In 1919 Bavaria Film was founded and in the 1920s Munich offered film makers an alternative to Germany's largest film studio, Babelsberg Studio. [74]

In  1923  Gustav  von  Kahr  was  appointed  Bavarian  prime  minister  and immediately planned for the expulsion of all Jews who did not hold German citizenship. Chief of Police Ernst Pöhner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences. [75] In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). [76]

Munich  was  chosen  as  capital  for  the  Free  State  of  Bavaria  and  acquired increased  responsibility  for  administering  the  city  itself  and  the  surrounding  districts.  Offices  needed  to  be  built  for bureaucracy, so a 12-story office building was erected in the southern part of the historic city centre in the late 1920s. [72]

Munich again  became  important  to  the  Nazis  when  they  took  power  in  Germany  in  1933.  The  party  created  its  first concentration camp at Dachau, 16 km (10 mi) north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung ("Capital of the Movement"). [77]

The NSDAP headquarters and the documentation apparatus for controlling all aspects of life were located in Munich. Nazi organizations, such as the National Socialist Women's League and the Gestapo, had their offices along Brienner Straße  and  around  the  Königsplatz.  The  party  acquired  68  buildings  in  the  area  and  many Führerbauten (" Führer buildings")  were  built  to  reflect  a  new  aesthetic  of  power. [78] Construction  work  for  the  Führerbau  and  the  party headquarters (known as the Brown House) started in September 1933. [79] The Haus der Kunst (House of German Art) was the first building to be commissioned by Hitler. The architect Paul Troost was asked to start work shortly after the Nazis had seized power because "the most German of all German cities" was left with no exhibition building when in 1931 the Glass Palace was destroyed in an arson attack. [80] The Red Terror that  supposedly  preceded  Nazi  control  in Munich  was  detailed  in  Nazi  publications;  seminal  accounts  are  that  of  Rudolf  Schricker Rotmord  über  München published in 1934, and Die Blutchronik des Marxismus in Deutschland by Adolf Ehrt and Hans Roden. [81]

In 1930 Feinkost Käfer was founded in Munich; the Käfer catering business is now a world leading party service. [82]

The  city  was  the  site  where  the  1938  Munich Agreement  signed  between  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Third  French Republic with Nazi Germany as part of the Franco-British policy of appeasement. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain  assented  to  the  German  annexation  of  Czechoslovakia's  Sudetenland  in  the  hopes  of  satisfying  Hitler's territorial expansion. [83]

The Munich-Riem Airport was completed in October 1939. [84]

On  8  November  1939,  shortly  after  the  Second  World  War  had  begun,  Georg  Elser  planted  a  bomb  in  the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, who held a political party speech. Hitler, however, had left the building minutes before the bomb went off. [85] By mid 1942 the majority of Jews living in Munich and the suburbs had been deported. [86]

During  the  war,  Munich  was  the  location  of  multiple  forced  labour  camps, including two Polenlager camps for Polish youth, [87][88] and 40 subcamps of the  Dachau  concentration  camp,  in  which  men  and  women  of  various nationalities  were  held. [89] With  up  to  17,000  prisoners  in  1945,  the  largest subcamp of Dachau was the Munich-Allach concentration camp.

Munich was the base of the White Rose, a student resistance movement. The group had distributed leaflets in several cities and following the 1943 Battle of  Stalingrad  members  of  the  group  stenciled  slogans  such  as  "Down  with Hitler" and "Hitler the Mass Murderer" on public buildings in Munich. The core members were arrested and executed after Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl were caught distributing leaflets on Munich University campus calling upon the youth to rise against Hitler. [90]

The city was heavily damaged by the bombing of Munich in World War II, with 71 air raids over five years. US troops captured Munich on 30 April 1945. [91]

## Postwar

In  the  aftermath  of  World  War  II,  Germany  and  Japan  were  subject  to  US  Military  occupation. [92] Due  to  Polish annexation of the Former eastern territories of Germany and expulsion of Germans from all over Eastern Europe, Munich operated  over  a  thousand  refugee  camps  for  151,113  people  in  October  1946. [93] After  US  occupation  Munich  was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid, bar a few exceptions owing to then-modern traffic concepts. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname Heimliche Hauptstadt ("secret capital") in the decades after World War II. [94] In Munich, the Bayerischer Rundfunk began its first television broadcast in 1954. [95]

The Free State of Bavaria used the arms industry as kernel for its high tech development policy. [96] Since 1963, Munich has been hosting the Munich Security Conference, held annually in the Hotel Bayerischer Hof. [97] Munich also became known on the political level due to the strong influence of Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Munich Airport, which commenced operations in 1992, was named in his honor. [98]

In the early 1960s Dieter Kunzelmann was expelled from the Situationist International and founded an influential group called Subversive Aktion in Munich. Kunzelmann was also active in West Berlin, and became known for using situationist avant-garde as a cover for political violence. [99]

Munich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics. After winning the bid in 1966 the Mayor of Munich Hans-Jochen Vogel accelerated the construction of the UBahn subway and the S-Bahn metropolitan commuter railway. In May 1967 the construction work began for a new U-Bahn line connecting the city with the Olympic Park. The Olympic Park subway station was built near the BMW Headquarters and the line was completed in May 1972, three months before the  opening  of  the  1972  Summer  Olympics.  Shortly  before  the  opening ceremony, Munich  also inaugurated a sizable pedestrian priority zone between  Karlsplatz  and  Marienplatz. [100] In  1970  the  Munich  city  council released funds so that the iconic gothic facade and Glockenspiel of the New City Hall (Neues Rathaus) could be restored. [101]

During the 1972 Summer Olympics 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Munich massacre, when gunmen from the Palestinian "Black September" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team. [102]

The most deadly militant attack the Federal Republic of Germany has ever witnessed was the Oktoberfest bombing. The attack was eventually blamed on militant Neo-Nazism. [103]

Munich and its urban sprawl emerged as the leading German high tech region during  the 1980s  and  1990s.  The  urban  economy  of  Munich  became characterized  by  a  dynamic  labour  market,  low  unemployment,  a  growing service  economy  and  high  per  capita  income. [96] Munich  is  home  of  the famous Nockherberg Strong Beer Festival  during  the  Lenten  fasting  period (usually  in  March).  Its  origins  go  back  to  the  17th/18th  century,  but  has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes  comical  speeches  and  a  mini-musical  in  which  numerous  German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors. [104]

In 2007 the ecological restoration of the river Isar in the urban area of Munich was  awarded  the  Water  Development  Prize  by  the  German Association  for

The Nockherberg beer garden

Water,  Wastewater  and  Waste  (known  as  DWA  in  German).  The  renaturation  of  the  Isar  allows  for  the  near  natural development of the river bed and is part of Munich's flood protection. [105] About 20 percent of buildings in Munich now have  a  green  roof.  Munich  city  council  has  been  encouraging  better  stormwater  management  since  the  1990s  with regulations and subsidies. [106]

On  the  fifth  anniversary  of  the  2011  Norway  attacks  an  active  shooter  perpetrated  a  hate  crime.  The  2016  Munich shooting targeted people of Turkish and Arab descent. [107]

Munich was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020, which was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, and was a host city for UEFA Euro 2024. [108]

## Geography

## Topography

Munich lies on the elevated plains of Upper Bavaria, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the northern edge of the Alps, at an altitude of about 520 m (1,706 ft) ASL. The local rivers are the Isar and the Würm. Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found  in  the  Alps,  while  the  southern  part  is  covered  with  morainic  hills. Between these are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of Munich.

## Climate

According to the Köppen climate classification, the climate is oceanic ( Cfb ), independent of the isotherm but with some humid continental ( Dfb ) features like warm to hot summers and cold winters, but without permanent snow cover. [109][110] The city centre lies between both climates, while the airport of Munich has a humid continental climate. The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.

The proximity to the Alps brings higher volumes of rainfall and consequently greater susceptibility to flood problems. Studies  of  adaptation  to  climate  change  and  extreme  events  are  carried  out;  one  of  them  is  the  Isar  Plan  of  the  EU Adaptation Climate. [111]

Showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in July, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.

The higher  elevation  and  proximity  to  the Alps  cause  the  city  to  have  more  rain  and  snow  than  many  other  parts  of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps (föhn wind), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.

Being at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.

Munich is near the Alps. Annual variation in temperature can be significant, because there are no large bodies of water nearby. The winter in Munich is generally cold and overcast, and some Munich winters have significant snow. January is the coldest month. While winter averages remain only moderately cold, and relatively mild for an elevated inland location of  Munich's latitude,  inversion  from  the  nearby Alps  causes  cold  air  to  sink  and  result  in  temperatures  below  -15  °C (5 °F). In Munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with daytime temperatures averaging 25 °C (77 °F).

Munich is subject to active convective seasons and sometimes damaging events. The Alpine thunderstorm system moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps. [112]

At Munich's official weather stations, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are 37.5 °C (100 °F), on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and -31.6 °C (-24.9 °F), on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city. [113][114]

In  Munich, the general trend of global warming with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about 1 °C (1.8 °F) in Germany between 1900 and 2020 can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20 °C (tropical nights), a change in precipitation patterns, as well as a rise in the number of local instances  of  heavy  rain,  is  to  be  expected  as  part  of  the  ongoing  climate  change.  The  city  administration  decided  to support a joint study from its own Referat für Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the German Meteorological Service that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection  in  Munich.  With  the  help  of  those  programs  issues  regarding  spatial  planning  and  settlement  density,  the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning ventilation in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.

## Demographics

From only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the city population doubled about every 30 years. It was 100,000 in 1852, 250,000 in 1883 and 500,000 in 1901. Since then, Munich  has  become  Germany's  third-largest  city.  In  1933,  840,901  inhabitants were counted, and in 1957 over 1 million. Munich has reached 1.5 million in 2022.

## Immigration

In December 2023, Munich had 1.58 million inhabitants; 477,855 foreign nationals resided in the city as of 31 December 2023 with 42.88% of these residents being citizens of EU member states, and 29.66% citizens in European states not in the EU (including Kosovo and Turkey). [120] Along with the Turks, the Croats are one of the two largest foreign minorities in the city, which is why some Croats refer to Munich as their "second capital". [121] The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks  (38,947),  Croats  (37,541),  Italians  (28,142),  Greeks  (24,843),  Bosnians (24,161) Ukrainians (21,899), and Austrians (21,944).

## Religion

About 45% of Munich's residents are not affiliated with any religious group; this ratio  represents  the  fastest  growing  segment  of  the  population. As  in  the  rest  of Germany,  the  Catholic  and  Protestant  churches  have  experienced  a  continuous decline in membership. As of 31 December 2017, 31.8% of the city's inhabitants were  Catholic,  11.4%  Protestant,  0.3%  Jewish  (see:  History  of  the  Jews  in

The governing coalition after the 2020 election consisted of the Greens and the SPD, as well as the allied Volt and Pink List, which had one seat each. While the Greens had gained the most seats in the city council, the mayor was from the SPD. The parties made an agreement including social and ecological goals and focusing on heightening stipulations for new development in the city. The Red-Green alliance is a reprise of the 1990-2014 coalition, which was interrupted by a six-year CSU-SPD majority from 2014 to 2020. [128][129]

In  the  Bundestag,  Munich  is  divided  between  four  constituencies.  In  the  20th  Bundestag,  the  composition  and representation of each was as follows:

| Constituency           | Area                                                                                                                                               | Party   | Member             |

## Subdivisions

Since the reform of 1992, Munich is divided into 25 administrative boroughs ( Stadtbezirke ). They are subdivided into 105 statistical areas.

<!-- image -->

Allach-Untermenzing (23), Altstadt-Lehel (1), Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied (22), Au-Haidhausen (5), Berg am Laim (14), Bogenhausen (13), Feldmoching-Hasenbergl  (24),  Hadern  (20),  Laim  (25),  LudwigsvorstadtIsarvorstadt (2), Maxvorstadt (3), Milbertshofen-Am Hart (11), Moosach (10), Neuhausen-Nymphenburg  (9),  Obergiesing  (17),  Pasing-Obermenzing  (21), Ramersdorf-Perlach  (16),  Schwabing-Freimann  (12),  Schwabing-West  (4), Schwanthalerhöhe  (8),  Sendling  (6),  Sendling-Westpark  (7),  ThalkirchenObersendling-Forstenried-Fürstenried-Solln  (19),  Trudering-Riem  (15),  and Untergiesing-Harlaching (18).

Munich's boroughs

There is no official division into districts. The number of districts is about 50, and if smaller units are counted as well, there are about 90 to 100 (see map).

The  three  largest  districts  are  Schwabing  in  the  north  (about  110,000  inhabitants),  Sendling  in  the  southwest  (about 100,000 inhabitants), and Giesing in the south (about 80,000 inhabitants). [130]

## Architecture

## Old Town

At the centre of the old town is the Marienplatz with the Old Town Hall and the New  Town  Hall.  Its  tower  contains  the  Rathaus-Glockenspiel.  The Peterskirche is the oldest church of the inner city. Nearby St. Peter, the Gothic hall-church  Heiliggeistkirche  was  converted  to  baroque  style  from  1724 onwards  and  looks  down  upon  the  Viktualienmarkt.  Three  gates  of  the demolished medieval fortification survive; these are the Isartor, the Sendlinger  Tor,  and  the  Karlstor.  The  Karlstor  leads  up  to  the  Stachus,  a square dominated by the Justizpalast (Palace of Justice).

The  Frauenkirche  serves  as  the  cathedral  for  the  Catholic  Archdiocese  of Munich  and  Freising.  The  nearby  Michaelskirche  is  the  largest  renaissance church north of the Alps, while the Theatinerkirche is a basilica in Italianate high  baroque,  which  had  a  major  influence  on  southern  German  baroque architecture. Its dome dominates the Odeonsplatz.

## Palaces and castles

Schloss Nymphenburg (Nymphenburg Palace, construction started 1664) is a museum open to the public for tours. [131][132]

The  smaller  Schloss  Fürstenried  (Fürstenried  Palace,  construction  17151717)  is  used  by  the Archdiocese  of  Munich  and  Freising  as  a  conference location. [133]

Schloss  Blutenburg  (Blutenburg  Castle)  opened  as  a  children's  library  in 2024, [134] but  visitors  may  tour  the  late-Gothic  Blutenburg  Castle  Church built on the same grounds. [135]

The large Munich Residenz complex on the edge of Munich's Old Town now ranks  among  Europe's  most  significant  museums  of  interior  decoration. Within  the  Residenz  is  the  splendid  Cuvilliés  Theatre  and  next  door  is  the National Theatre Munich. Among the mansions that still exist in Munich are

the Palais Porcia, the Palais Preysing, the Palais Holnstein and the Prinz-CarlPalais. All mansions are situated close to the Residenz, so is the Alter Hof, the first residence of the House of Wittelsbach.

## Modernist architecture

Despite  Munich  being  the  breeding  ground  for  German  Jugendstil,  starting with  the architect Martin  Dülfer,  Munich  Jugendstil  style  was  quickly submerged as historic  trash. While  the  modernist  architect Theodor  Fischer was based in Munich, his influence on Munich underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of Munich was under-industrialized. During the Weimar Republic, the Munich establishment was hostile to modernism. The TUM professor German Bestelmeyer favored a conservative style, and Jacobus Oud was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by  Robert  Vorhoelzer  built  in  the  late  1920s  and  early  1930s. Examples of avant-garde temporary constructions include the Wohnmaschine

The Ruffinihaus at Rindermarkt

<!-- image -->

( Housing  Machine )  by  Robert  V orhoelzer,  as  well  as  the Flachdachhaus ( Flat  Roof  House )  by  Fritz  Norkauer.  Paul Schultze-Naumburg, and the Kampfbund enjoyed particular popularity. [136]

## High rise buildings

Several high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the HVB Tower, the Arabella High-Rise Building, the Highlight Towers, Uptown Munich, Münchner Tor and the BMW Headquarters next to the Olympic Park. Further high-rise buildings are located in the Werksviertel in Berg am Laim.

## Long-term residential development

Munich  is  subject  to  a  long-term  residential  development  plan  that  is established  by  the  city  administration  of  Munich.  The  LaSie  ("Langfristige Siedlungsentwicklung") was passed in 2011 in response to the acute housing crisis. LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for Munich

The HVB Tower at Arabellapark

<!-- image -->

in  1998 ("Perspektive München"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in Munich. Existing  housing  estates,  post-war  low-density  developments,  and  the  suburban  area  are  subject  to  densification ("Nachverdichtung"). Non-residential industrial areas are subject to conservation and will be turned into residential and mixed-use areas. On greenfield sites in the Munich periphery medium and large-scale housing estates are to be built so as to extend Munich's urban center. [137]

## Parks

Friedrich  Ludwig  von  Sckell  became  famous  for  designing  the  Englischer Garten between 1789 and 1807. Besides planning the first public garden in Europe,  Sckell  also  redesigned  Baroque  gardens  as  landscape  gardens, including  the  parks  of  Nymphenburg  Palace  and  the  Botanischer  Garten München-Nymphenburg. [138]

Other large green spaces are the Olympiapark, the Westpark and the Ostpark. The city's oldest park is the Hofgarten, near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th  century.  The  site  of  the  largest  beer  garden  in  town,  the  former  royal Hirschgarten, was founded in 1780.

## Football

Munich is home to several professional Association football teams including the  FC  Bayern  Munich.  Other  notable  clubs  include  1860  Munich,  who currently  play  in  the  3.  Liga.  Noticeably,  FC  Bayern  Munich  is  the  most successful club in Germany and it is also very reputed across Europe and the world. Munich hosted matches in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. [139]

## Basketball

FC  Bayern  Munich  Basketball  is  currently  playing  in  the  Beko  Basket Bundesliga. The city hosted the final  stages  of  the  FIBA  EuroBasket  1993, where the German national basketball team won the gold medal.

## Ice hockey

The  city's  ice  hockey  club  is  EHC  Red  Bull  München  who  play  in  the Deutsche  Eishockey  Liga. The  team  has  won  four  DEL  Championships,  in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2023.

## Olympics

Munich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics; the Munich massacre took place in the Olympic village. It was one of the host cities for the 2006 Football World Cup, which was not held in Munich's Olympic Stadium, but in a new football specific stadium, the Allianz Arena. Munich bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, but lost to Pyeongchang. [140] In September 2011 the DOSB President Thomas Bach confirmed that Munich would bid again for the Winter Olympics in the future. [141] These plans were abandoned some time later.

## Road running

Regular  annual  road  running  events  in  Munich  are  the  Munich  Marathon  in  October,  the  Stadtlauf  end  of  June,  the company run B2Run in July, the New Year's Run on 31 December, the Spartan Race Sprint, the Olympia Alm Crosslauf and the Bestzeitenmarathon.

## Swimming

Public sporting facilities in Munich include ten indoor swimming pools [142] and  eight  outdoor  swimming  pools, [143] which  are  operated  by  the  Munich City  Utilities  (SWM)  communal  company. [144] Popular  indoor  swimming pools include the Olympia Schwimmhalle of the 1972 Summer Olympics, the wave pool Cosimawellenbad, as well as the Müllersches Volksbad which was built in 1901. Further, swimming within Munich's city limits is also possible in several  artificial lakes  such  as  for  example  the  Riemer  See  or  the Langwieder lake district. [145]

## River surfing

River surfing is a popular sport in Munich. The Flosskanal wave in the south of Munich is less challenging. A well visited surfing spot for experienced surfers is the Eisbach standing wave, where the annual Munich Surf Open is celebrated on the last Saturday of July. [146]

## Culture

## Language

German is spoken and understood in and around Munich. While the German language has many dialects, so-called "Standard German" or "High German" is learned in schools and spoken among Germans, Austrians and in some parts of Switzerland. A speaker of a Low German dialect in Hamburg may find it difficult to understand  the  dialect  of  a Bavarian  mountaineer. [147] The

<!-- image -->

Bavarian dialects are recognized as regional language and continues to be spoken alongside Standard German. [148]

## Museums

The gothic Morris dancers of Erasmus Grasser are exhibited in the Munich City Museum in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.

In 1903 Oskar von Miller assembled a group of engineers and industrialists, who  chartered  the  Deutsches  Museum.  The  Museum  was  built  with  the financial support of the German business and imperial nobility community, as well  as  the  blessing  of  Wilhelm  II,  German  Emperor. [149] The  Deutsches Museum  had  its  grand  opening  in  1925,  but  has  undergone  a  reinvention recently. The Deutsches Museum now operates three locations. The original site in central Munich continues to expand its exhibits. [150]

The city has several important art galleries, most of which can be found in the Kunstareal. The Lenbachhaus displays works  of  the  movement  Der  Blaue  Reiter (The Blue Rider), a Munich-based modernist  art.  Starting  in  1970s,  German municipalities started to respond to cultural tourism  and  invested  in  public  museums.

The Glyptothek

<!-- image -->

The  Neue  Pinakothek,  like  other  German  museums,  was  wholly  reconstructed  from 1974 until 1981. [151] The Pinakothek der Moderne lets the public see an eclectic mix of contemporary art and the principle  attention  of  the  permanent  collection  is  Classical Moderns.  But  the  displays  are  enhanced  continuously  with  spectacular  gifts  from private collections. [152]

Bavarian National Museum

City guides published in the early 1860s directed tourists to Munich's architecture and art collections, which at the time were unique in Germany and are a legacy mainly of Ludwig I of Bavaria, with contributions from Maximilian II of Bavaria. [153] The Alte

Pinakothek contains works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. Major displays include Albrecht Dürer's Self-Portrait (1500), his Four Apostles , Raphael's paintings The Canigiani Holy Family and Madonna Tempi as well as Peter Paul Rubens large Judgment Day .

An extensive collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the Glyptothek [154] and the Staatliche Antikensammlungen (the State Antiquities Collections). Works on display include the Medusa Rondanini, the Barberini Faun and figures from the Temple of Aphaea on Aegina for the Glyptothek. [155] Another interesting museum is the Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst (the State Collection of Egyptian Art). [156][157][158]

Several  public  collections  of  the  Ludwig  Maximilian  University  of  Munich  are  still  housed  in  the  Kunstareal.  The expanded state collections are housed in the Paläontologisches Museum München, and the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. After the first German art exhibition in the Glaspalast for an international audience in 1869, Munich emerged as a focal point for the arts. Men of distinction from around the world visited the Academy of Fine Arts under the directorship of Karl von Piloty and later Wilhelm von Kaulbach. [159]

The Museum Five Continents is the second largest collection in Germany of artefacts  and  objects  from  outside  Europe,  while  the  Bavarian  National Museum and the adjoining Bavarian State Archaeological Collection display regional art and cultural history. The Schackgalerie is an important gallery of German 19th-century paintings. [160]

The  memorial  museum  of  the  former  Dachau  concentration  camp  is  just outside the city.

## Music

Munich is a major international musical centre and has played host to many prominent  composers  including  Orlande  de  Lassus,  Wolfgang  Amadeus Mozart,  Carl  Maria  von  Weber,  Richard  Wagner,  Gustav  Mahler,  Richard Strauss,  Max  Reger  and  Carl  Orff.  Some  of  classical  music's  best-known compositions have been created in and around Munich by composers born in the area, for example, Richard Strauss's tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra or Carl Orff's Carmina Burana . [161]

## Opera

Richard Wagner was a supporter of William I, German Emperor, but Wagner only  found  a  generous  patron  in  Ludwig  II  of  Bavaria. [162] 1870  til  1871 Wagner  premiered  Die  Meistersinger  von  Nürnberg  ( The  Mastersingers  of Nuremberg )  in  Munich,  a  popular  success  for Wagner  and  King  Ludwig  II. Wagner premiered at the Hoftheater, now the National Theatre Munich, with Angelo Quaglio the Younger designing the premiere production. [163]

The National Theatre Munich is now the home of the Bavarian State Opera and  the  Bavarian  State  Orchestra.  Next  door,  the  modern  Residenz  Theatre was  erected  in  the  building  that  also  houses  the  Cuvilliés  Theatre.  The Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz is a state theater while another opera house, the Prinzregententheater, has become the home of the Bavarian Theater Academy and the Munich Chamber Orchestra.

## Orchestra

The modern Gasteig centre houses the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Its primary concert venue is the Herkulessaal in the former city royal residence, the Munich Residenz. Many important conductors have been attracted by the city's orchestras, including Felix  Weingartner,  Hans  Pfitzner,  Hans  Rosbaud,  Hans  Knappertsbusch,  Sergiu  Celibidache,  James  Levine,  Christian Thielemann, Lorin Maazel, Rafael Kubelík, Eugen Jochum, Sir Colin Davis, Mariss Jansons, Bruno Walter, Georg Solti, Zubin Mehta and Kent Nagano. A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the Deutsche Theater. It is Germany's largest theatre for guest performances. [164]

## Pop and electronica

Munich was the centre of Krautrock in southern Germany, with many important bands such as Amon Düül II, Embryo or Popol Vuh hailing from the city. In the 1970s, the Musicland Studios developed into one of the most prominent recording studios in the world, with bands such as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Queen recording albums there. Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer Giorgio Moroder, who invented synth disco and electronic dance music, and Donna Summer, one of disco music's most important performers, both living and working in the  city.  In  the  late  1990s,  Electroclash  was  substantially  co-invented  if  not even invented in Munich, when DJ Hell introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his International DeeJay Gigolo Records label here. [165]

Other notable musicians and bands from Munich include Konstantin Wecker, Willy Astor, Spider Murphy Gang, Münchener Freiheit, Lou Bega, Megaherz, FSK, Colour Haze and Sportfreunde Stiller.

Munich  hosted several Love Parades and Mayday  Party rave events throughout the 1990s. Munich continues to rave, the local youth scenes are active. [166]

## Theatre

The Munich Kammerspiele is one of the most important German-language theaters. Since Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich, they include Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Henrik Ibsen, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.

## Schwabing

At  the  turn  of  the  20th  century  Schwabing  was  a  preeminent  cultural metropolis. Schwabing was an epicenter for both literature and the fine arts, with numerous German and non-German artists living there. [167]

Vladimir  Lenin  authored What  Is  to  Be  Done? while  living  in  Schwabing. Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene were Künstlerlokale ( Artist's Cafés ) like Café Stefanie or Kabarett Simpl, whose liberal ways differed fundamentally  from  Munich's  more  traditional  localities.  The  Simpl,  which survives  to  this  day,  was  named  after  Munich's  anti-authoritarian  satirical magazine Simplicissimus ,  founded  in  1896  by  Albert  Langen  and  Thomas Theodor Heine, which quickly became an important organ of the Schwabinger Bohème . Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on Wilhelmine  German  society  were  the  result  of  countless  of  collaborative efforts  by  many  of  the  best  visual  artists  and  writers  from  Munich  and elsewhere.

In 1971 Eckart Witzigmann teamed up with a Munich building contractor to finance and open the Tantris restaurant in Schwabing. Witzigmann is credited for starting the German Küchenwunder ( kitchen wonder ). [168]

## Biedermeier

The Biedermeier era was named after a character that regularly appeared in the satire magazine Münchner Fliegende Blätter ( Loose Munich Pages ), which was published by Adolf Kussmaul and Ludwig Eichrodt in Munich between 1855 and 1857. Biedermeier was a synonym for arts, furniture, and the lifestyle of the nonheroic middle class. The Biedermeier era painters Ferdinand Georg  Waldmüller,  Moritz von  Schwind,  and  Carl Spitzweg  are shown  in the Neue Pinakothek. [169]

## Prinzregentenzeit

Celebrity literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final decades of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the so-called Prinzregentenzeit (literally prince  regent's  time )  under  the  reign  of  Luitpold,  Prince  Regent  of  Bavaria.  This  includes Thomas  Mann,  Heinrich  Mann,  Paul  Johann  Ludwig  von  Heyse,  Rainer  Maria  Rilke,  Ludwig  Thoma,  Fanny  zu

The Golden Friedensengel

## Weimar Republic

The  period  immediately  before  World  War  I  saw  continued  economic  and  cultural prominence  for  the  city.  Thomas  Mann  wrote  in  his  novella Gladius  Dei about  this period: "München leuchtete" (literally "Munich shone"). Munich remained a centre of cultural  life  during  the  Weimar  Republic,  with  figures  such  as  Lion  Feuchtwanger, Bertolt Brecht, Peter Paul Althaus, Stefan George, Ricarda Huch, Joachim Ringelnatz, Oskar Maria Graf, Annette Kolb, Ernst Toller, Hugo Ball, and Klaus Mann adding to the already established big names.

Karl  Valentin,  the  cabaret  performer  and  comedian,  is  to  this  day  remembered  and beloved  as  a  cultural  icon  of  his  hometown.  Between  1910  and  1940,  he  wrote  and performed  in  many  absurdist  sketches  and  short  films  that  were  highly  influential, earning him the nickname of "Charlie Chaplin of Germany". [170][171]

Liesl  Karlstadt,  before  working  together  with  Valentin,  cross-dressed  and  performed cabaret with yodeling on stage and in Munich's Cafe-Theatres. The cabaret scene was crushed  when  the  Nazis  seized  power  in  1933  and  Karlstadt  was  saved  from  Nazi sterilization by a doctor. Contemporary Munich cabaret still reverences 1920s cabaret, the Munich alternative rock band F.S.K. absorbs yodels. [172]

## Post-war literature

After World War II, Munich soon again became a focal point of the German literary scene and remains so to this day, with writers as diverse as Wolfgang Koeppen, Erich Kästner, Eugen Roth, Alfred Andersch, Elfriede Jelinek, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Michael Ende, Franz Xaver Kroetz, Gerhard Polt and Patrick Süskind calling the city their home.

## Fine arts

From the Gothic to the Baroque era, the fine arts were represented in Munich by artists like Erasmus Grasser, Jan Polack, Johann Baptist Straub, Ignaz Günther, Hans Krumpper, Ludwig von Schwanthaler, Cosmas Damian Asam, Egid Quirin Asam, Johann Baptist Zimmermann, Johann Michael Fischer and François de Cuvilliés. Munich had already become an important  place  for  painters  like  Carl  Rottmann,  Lovis  Corinth,  Wilhelm  von  Kaulbach,  Carl  Spitzweg,  Franz  von Lenbach, Franz Stuck, Karl Piloty and Wilhelm Leibl.

## Cinema

Munich  was  (and  in  some  cases,  still  is)  home  to  many  of  the  most  important  authors  of  the  New  German  Cinema movement, including Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Edgar Reitz and Herbert Achternbusch. In 1971, the Filmverlag der Autoren was founded, cementing the city's role in the movement's history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder's films, among them Ali: Fear Eats the Soul . The Hotel Deutsche Eiche near Gärtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his "clan" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the  most  important  artistic  movement  in  German  cinema  history  since  the  era  of  German  Expressionism  in  the 1920s. [173][174]

In 1919, the Bavaria Film Studios were founded, which developed into one of Europe's largest  film  studios.  Directors  like Alfred  Hitchcock,  Billy Wilder, Orson  Welles,  John  Huston,  Ingmar  Bergman,  Stanley  Kubrick,  Claude Chabrol,  Fritz  Umgelter,  Rainer  Werner  Fassbinder,  Wolfgang  Petersen  and Wim Wenders made films there. Among the internationally well-known films produced at the studios are The Pleasure Garden (1925) by Alfred Hitchcock,

The Great Escape (1963)  by  John  Sturges, Paths of  Glory (1957)  by  Stanley  Kubrick, Willy  Wonka  &amp;  the  Chocolate Factory (1971)  by  Mel  Stuart  and  both Das  Boot (1981)  and The  Neverending  Story (1984)  by  Wolfgang  Petersen. Munich remains one of the centres of the German film and entertainment industry. [175]

## Festivals

## Coopers' Dance

The  Coopers'  Dance  (German: Schäfflertanz )  is  a  guild  dance  of  coopers originally  started  in  Munich.  Since  early  1800s  the  custom  spread  via journeymen in it is now a common tradition over the Old Bavaria region. The dance was supposed to be held every seven years. [176]

## Starkbierfest

March and April, for three weeks during Lent, celebrating Munich's "strong beer".  Starkbier  was  created  in  1651  by  the  local  Paulinerkirche,  Leipzig monks who drank this 'Flüssiges Brot', or 'liquid bread'. It became a public festival  in  1751  and  is  now  the  second  largest  beer  festival  in  Munich.  A Starkbierfest may be celebrated in beer halls and pubs.

## Cuisine and culinary specialities

The Munich cuisine contributes to the Bavarian cuisine. Munich Weisswurst ("white sausage", German: Münchner Weißwurst ) was invented here in 1857. It  is  a  Munich  speciality.  Traditionally  Weisswurst  is  served  in  pubs  before noon and is served with sweet mustard and freshly baked pretzels.

Munich  has  11  restaurants  that  have  been  awarded  one  or  more  Michelin Guide stars in 2021. [183]

## Beers and breweries

Munich is known for its breweries and Weissbier ( wheat beer ). Helles, a pale lager with a translucent gold color, is the most popular contemporary Munich beer.  Helles  has  largely  replaced Munich's dark beer, known  as Dunkel, which gets its color from roasted  malt.  It  was  the  typical beer in Munich in the 19th century. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with a high alcohol content of 6%-9%.  It is dark amber  in  color  and  has  a  heavy malty  taste.  The  beer  served  at Oktoberfest  is  a  special  type  of beer with a higher alcohol content.

Beer garden in Munich

Wirtshäuser  are  traditional  Bavarian  pubs,  many  of  which  also  have  small outside  areas.  Biergärten  ( beer  gardens )  are  a  popular  fixture  in  Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture, and are an overt melting pot for members of all walks of life, regardless of social class. There are many smaller beer gardens, but some beer gardens have thousands of seats. Large beer gardens can be found in the Englischer Garten, on the Nockherberg, and in the Hirschgarten.

There  are  six  main  breweries  in  Munich  are  Augustiner-Bräu,  Hacker-Pschorr  Brewery,  Hofbräuhaus,  Löwenbräu, Paulaner, and Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu. Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich.

## Circus

The Circus Krone based in Munich is one of the largest circuses in Europe. [184] It was the first and still is one of only a few in Western Europe to also occupy a building of its own.

## Nightlife

Nightlife  in  Munich  is  located  mostly  in  the  boroughs  LudwigsvorstadtIsarvorstadt,  Maxvorstadt,  Au-Haidhausen,  Berg  am  Laim  and  Sendling. Between  Sendlinger  Tor  and  Maximiliansplatz,  on  the  edge  of  the  central Altstadt-Lehel district, there is also the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a  roughly  banana-shaped  unofficial  party  zone  spanning  1.3  km  (0.8  mi) along Sonnenstraße, characterized by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants,  which  became  the  center  of  Munich's  nightlife  in  the  mid2000s. [185]

In  the  1960s  and  1970s,  Schwabing  was  considered  a  center  of  nightlife  in Germany, with internationally known clubs such as Big Apple, PN hit-house , Domicile , Hot Club , Piper Club , Tiffany , Germany's first large-scale discotheque Blow Up and the underwater nightclub Yellow Submarine, [165][186][187] and Munich has been called "New York's big disco sister"  in  this  context. [165][188] Bars  in  the  Schwabing  district  of  this  era include, among many others, Schwabinger 7 and Schwabinger Podium . Since the 1980s, however, Schwabing has lost much of its nightlife activity due to gentrification and the resulting high rents, and the formerly wild artists' and students' quarter developed into one of the city's most coveted and expensive residential districts, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying. [189]

Since the 1960s, the Rosa Viertel (pink quarter) developed in the

Glockenbachviertel and around Gärtnerplatz , which in the 1980s made Munich "one of the four gayest metropolises in the world" along with San Francisco, New York City and Amsterdam. [190] In particular, the area around Müllerstraße and Hans-Sachs-Straße was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs. One of them was the travesty nightclub Old Mrs. Henderson , where Freddie Mercury, who lived in Munich from 1979 to 1985, filmed the music video for the song Living on My Own at his 39th birthday party. [190][187][191]

Since the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik , a former industrial complex that was converted to a large  party  area  near  München  Ostbahnhof  in  Berg  am  Laim,  hosted  more  than  30  clubs  and  was  especially  popular among younger people from the metropolitan area surrounding Munich and tourists. [190][192] The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area. Apart from the Kultfarbik and the smaller Optimolwerke , there is a wide variety of establishments in the urban parts of nearby Haidhausen. Before the Kunstpark Ost, there had already been an accumulation of internationally known nightclubs in the remains of the abandoned former Munich-Riem Airport. [165][193][194]

Munich  nightlife  tends  to  change  dramatically  and  quickly.  Establishments open  and  close  every  year,  and  due  to  gentrification  and  the  overheated housing  market  many  survive  only  a  few  years,  while  others  last  longer. Beyond  the  already  mentioned  venues  of  the  1960s  and  1970s,  nightclubs with international recognition in recent history included Tanzlokal Größenwahn , The Atomic Café and the techno clubs Babalu Club, Ultraschall, KW -Das Heizkraftwerk, Natraj Temple, MMA  Club  (Mixed  Munich  Arts), Die  Registratur and Bob  Beaman . [195] From 1995 to 2001, Munich was also home to the Union Move, one of the largest technoparades in Germany. [186]

Munich has the highest density of music venues of any German city, followed by Hamburg, Cologne and Berlin. [196][197] Within the city's limits are more than 100 nightclubs and thousands of bars

and restaurants. [198][199]

Some  notable  nightclubs  are:  popular  techno  clubs  are  Blitz  Club, Harry  Klein , Rote  Sonne , Bahnwärter  Thiel, Pimpernel , Charlie , Palais and Pathos . [200][201] Popular mixed music clubs are Call me Drella , Wannda Circus , Tonhalle , Backstage , Muffathalle , Ampere Pacha P1 , , , Zenith, Minna Thiel and the party ship Alte Utting.

legislation concerning the concentration of particulate in the air, environmental groups such as Greenpeace have staged large protest rallies to urge the city council and the state government to take a harder stance on pollution. [216] Due to the high standard of living in and the thriving economy of the city and the region, there was an influx of people and Munich's population surpassed 1.5 million by June 2015, an increase of more than 20% in 10 years.

## Transport

Munich has an extensive public transport system consisting of an underground metro, trams, buses and high-speed rail. In 2015, the transport modal share in Munich was 38 percent public transport, 25 percent car, 23 percent walking, and 15 percent bicycle. [217] Its public transport system delivered 566 million passenger trips that year. [218]

Munich is the hub of a developed regional transportation system, including the second-largest airport in Germany and the Berlin-Munich high-speed railway, which connects Munich to the German capital city with a journey time of about 4 hours. Flixmobility which offers intercity coach service is headquartered in Munich.

The trade fair Transport Logistic is held every two years at the Neue Messe München (Messe München International).

## Public transport

Public transport network

<!-- image -->

For its urban population of 2.6 million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the Munich U-Bahn, the Munich S-Bahn, trams and buses. The system is supervised by the Munich  Transport  and  Tariff  Association  ( Münchner  Verkehrs-  und Tarifverbund ). The Munich tramway is the oldest existing public transportation  system  in  the  city,  which  has  been  in  operation  since  1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines. The average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min.

The extensive network of subway and tram lines assists and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Straße, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east-west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. These attributes result from applying the principle of filtered permeability. Pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire Munich city centre, go through public squares and open spaces for enjoyment. Munich city centre was subject to urban planning and has a comprehensive model for laying out neighborhoods and districts according to grid plan. [219]

## Cycling

Cycling  has  a  strong  presence  in  the  city  and  is  recognized  as  a  good alternative. The growing number of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets,  although  the  newer  or  renovated  ones  are  much  easier  to  tell  apart from  pavements  than  older  ones.  A  modern  bike  hire  system  is  available within the area bounded by the Mittlerer Ring .

## Cultural history trails and bicycle routes

Since 2001, historically interesting places in Munich can be explored via the List of cultural history trails in Munich ( KulturGeschichtsPfade ). Sign-posted cycle  routes  are  the  Outer Äußere  Radlring (outer  cycle  route)  and  the RadlRing München . [220]

## Munich Central Train Station

München Hauptbahnhof is the central railway station located in the city centre and is the long-distance station in Munich.

Munich Central Train Station serves about 450,000 passengers a day, which puts it on par with other large stations in Germany. Munich Central Train Station alongside München Ost railway station are two of the 21 stations in Germany classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 1 station.

The central mainline station is a terminal station with 32 platforms. The subterranean S-Bahn with 2 platforms and UBahn stations with 6 platforms are through stations.

The Intercity-Express (ICE) stop at Munich Central Train Station. InterCity and EuroCity trains to destinations east of Munich  also  stop  at  the  München  Ost  railway  station.  Munich  is  connected  to  Nuremberg  via  Ingolstadt  by  the Nuremberg-Munich high-speed railway and Berlin-Munich high-speed railway.

The old air raid shelter next to platform 11 of Munich Central Train Station was an important distribution point for guest workers  ( Gastarbeiter )  between  1960  and  1973.  At  peak  more  than  1,000  guest  workers  arrived  per  day,  in  total 1.8 million guest workers passed through Munich Central Train Station. [221]

## Autobahns

Munich  is  an  integral  part  of  the Autobahn  network  of  southern  Germany. Motorways  from  Stuttgart  (W),  Nuremberg,  Frankfurt  and  Berlin (N), Deggendorf and Passau (E), Salzburg and Innsbruck (SE), Garmisch Partenkirchen  (S)  and  Lindau  (SW)  terminate  at  Munich,  allowing  direct access to the different parts of Germany, Austria and Italy.

Traffic  is  often  very  heavy  in  and  around  Munich.  Traffic  congestion  are commonplace at the beginning and end of major Bavarian holidays. There are few "green waves" or roundabouts, and an abundance of construction sites.

Munich  has  introduced  an  environmental  zone  and  was  among  the  first German cities to require a green sticker for vehicles, these are a requirement when entering the city or driving in the wider surrounding area. [222]

## Munich International Airport

Franz Josef Strauss International Airport (IATA: MUC, ICAO: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after London Heathrow,  Paris  Charles  de  Gaulle,  Frankfurt,  Amsterdam,  Madrid  and Istanbul Atatürk.  It  is  used  by  about  46  million  passengers  a  year,  and  lies some  30  km  (19  mi)  north  east  of  the  city  centre.  It  replaced  the  smaller Munich-Riem Airport in 1992. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines  from  the  city.  From  the  main  railway  station  the  journey  takes  40-45 minutes. A magnetic levitation train (called Transrapid), which was to have run  at  speeds  of  up  to  400  km/h  (249  mph)  from  the  central  station  to  the airport  in  a  travel  time  of  10  minutes,  had  been  approved, [223] but  was cancelled in March  2008  because  of cost escalation and after heavy

protests. [224] Lufthansa opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.

## Other airports

In  2008,  the  Bavarian  state  government  granted  a  licence  to  expand  Oberpfaffenhofen  Air  Station  located  west  of Munich, for commercial use. These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court. [225] However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge. [226]

Despite being 110 km (68 mi) from Munich, Memmingen Airport has been advertised as Airport Munich West. After 2005,  passenger  traffic  of  nearby Augsburg Airport  was  relocated  to  Munich Airport,  leaving  the Augsburg  region  of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach.

## Around Munich

## Nearby towns

The  Munich  agglomeration  sprawls  across  the  plain  of  the Alpine  foothills  comprising  about  2.6  million  inhabitants. Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns and cities like Dachau, Freising, Erding, Starnberg, Landshut and Moosburg are today part of the Greater Munich Region, formed by Munich and the surrounding districts, making up the Munich Metropolitan Region, which has a population of about 6 million people. [4]

## Recreation

South  of  Munich,  there  are  numerous  nearby  freshwater  lakes  such  as  Lake  Starnberg,  Ammersee,  Chiemsee, Walchensee, Kochelsee, Tegernsee, Schliersee, Simssee, Staffelsee, Wörthsee, Kirchsee and the Osterseen (Easter Lakes), which are popular among Munich residents for recreation, swimming and watersports and can be quickly reached by car and a few also by Munich's S-Bahn.
