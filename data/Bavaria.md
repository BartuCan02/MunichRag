## Bavaria

Bavaria , [a] officially  the Free State of Bavaria , [b] is  a  state  in  the  southeast  of  Germany. With an area of 70,550.19 km  (27,239.58 sq mi), it is the largest German state by land area, 2 comprising approximately 1/5 of the total land area of Germany, and with over 13.08 million inhabitants,  it  is  the  second  most  populous  German  state,  behind  only  North  RhineWestphalia; however, due to its large land area, its population density is below the German average.  Major  cities  include  Munich  (its  capital  and  largest  city,  which  is  also  the  third largest city in Germany), [6] Nuremberg, and Augsburg.

The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes, followed by the  conquests  of  the  Roman  Empire  in  the  1st  century  BC,  when  the  territory  was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum. It became the Duchy of Bavaria (a stem duchy) in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire, became the independent Kingdom of Bavaria after 1806, joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom, and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. [7]

Bavaria  has  a  distinct  culture,  largely  because  of  its  Catholic  heritage  and  conservative traditions, [8] which  includes  a  language,  cuisine,  architecture,  festivals  and  elements  of Alpine symbolism. [9] It  also  has  the  second-largest  economy  among  the  German  states  by GDP figures, giving it the status of a wealthy German region. [10]

Contemporary Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of Franconia and Swabia, in addition to Altbayern.

## History

## Antiquity

Though Bavaria has been occupied by humans since the Paleolithic era, Celtic tribes of the Bronze Age, such as the Boii were the first documented inhabitants of the Bavarian Alps. In June  2023, Archeologists  discovered  a  bronze  sword,  dated  to  the  14th  century  BC,  in  a former Celtic village; its workmanship so well-preserved "it almost shines." [11] During the early  modern  era,  these  peoples  were  retrospectively  romanticized  as  the  most  ancient culture of Bavaria, [12] even though the Indo-European languages were relative newcomers to the region. Evidence of the ancient Straubing culture, Únětice culture and La Tène culture may be found in what is Bavaria today. [13][14][15]

Archeologists know  of a large Celtic Iron Age  settlement which was founded in Feldmoching-Hasenbergl, in the North of suburban Munich. [15] Evidence suggests up to 500 people lived in the village from 450 BC. [15] Local life appears to have centred around what could  be  a  town  hall  or  temple,  and  continued  in  different  forms  up  to  1000  AD. [15] In Manching, Upper Bavaria, an unfortified and semi-urban society appears to have prospered between the 3rd century BC until the early 1st century AD. [16] The settlement featured food ovens,  pottery  kilns  and  metallurgical  furnaces. [16] By  200  BC  the  community  there  was active  in  trade-finds  of  coins,  along  with  an  icon-like  golden  tree  suggest  it  was  trading with distant Italo-Greek communities. [16]

In  the  1st  century  BC,  Bavaria  was  conquered  by  the  Roman  Empire. [17] An  imperial military  camp  was  built  60  km  north-west  of  where  Munich  sits  today,  under  orders  of Augustus  Caesar,  between  8  and  5  BC. [18] The  camp  later  became  the  town  of  Augusta Vindelicorum, which would become the capital of the Roman province of Raetia. [18] Another fort was founded in 60 AD, west of modern-day Manching, as evidenced by a legionnaire's sandal  found  near  remains  of  an  ancient  fort. [19] By  the  late  2nd  century  AD,  Germanic tribes,  including  Marcomanni  people,  were  pushing  back  on  Roman  forces  of  Marcus Aurelius and later, Commodus in the Marcomannic Wars. [20] By 180 AD, Commodus had decided  to  abandon  the  annexed  positions  in  Bavaria,  leaving  its  control  to  Celtic  and Germanic tribes. [21]

## Middle Ages

Around the year 500 AD, some elements of that victorious Marcomanni people helped form the  Bavarii  confederation,  which  incorporated  Bohemia  and  Bavaria. [22] In  the  530s,  the Merovingian dynasty incorporated the kingdom of Thuringia after their defeat by the Franks. The  Baiuvarii  were  Frankicised  a  century  later. [23] The  Lex  Thuringorum  documents  an upper class nobility of adalingi . [24] From about 554 to 788, the house of Agilolfing ruled the Duchy of Bavaria, ending with Tassilo III who was deposed by Charlemagne. [25]

Tassilo I of Bavaria tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of Slavic peoples and the Pannonian Avars around 600. Garibald II seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616. [26]

At Hugbert's death in 735, the duchy passed to Odilo of Bavaria from the neighboring Alemannia. Odilo issued a Lex Baiuvariorum for Bavaria, completed the process of church organization in partnership with Saint Boniface in 739, and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the Carolingian dynasty. He was defeated near Augsburg in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748. [27][28]

Saint Boniface completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century. Tassilo III of Bavaria succeeded to rule Bavaria. He initially  ruled  under  Frankish  oversight  but  began  to  function  independently  from  763  onward.  He  was  particularly  noted  for  founding  new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, oppressing Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the Danube and colonizing these lands. After 781, however,  Charlemagne  began  to  exert  pressure  and  Tassilo  III  was  deposed  in  788.  Dissenters  attempted  a  coup  against  Charlemagne  at Regensburg in 792, led by Pepin the Hunchback.

With the revolt of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and southeast.

One of the most important dukes of Bavaria was Henry the Lion of the house of Welf, founder of Munich, and de facto the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of Saxony and Bavaria by his cousin, Frederick I, Holy Roman  Emperor  (a.k.a.  "Barbarossa"  for  his  red  beard),  Bavaria  was  awarded  as  fief  to  the Wittelsbach family, counts palatinate of Schyren ("Scheyern" in modern German). They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. In 1180, however, Styria was also separated from Bavaria. The Electorate of the Palatinate by Rhine ( Kurpfalz in  German) was also acquired by the House of Wittelsbach in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries. [29]

The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the Hohenstaufen in 1268, Swabian territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. Emperor Louis the Bavarian acquired Brandenburg, Tyrol, Holland and Hainaut for his House but released the Upper Palatinate for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. That time also Salzburg finally became independent from the Duchy of Bavaria.

<!-- image -->

In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392: BavariaStraubing, Bavaria-Landshut, Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Bavaria-Munich. In 1506 with the Landshut War of Succession, the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital. The country became a center of the Jesuit-inspired Counter-Reformation.

## Electorate of Bavaria

In 1623, the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the Electorate of the Palatinate in the early days of the Thirty Years' War and acquired the powerful prince-elector dignity in the Holy Roman Empire, determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status  under  the  empire's  laws.  During  the  early  and  mid-18th  century  the  ambitions  of  the  Bavarian  prince  electors  led  to  several  wars  with Austria as well as occupations by Austria (War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession with the election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburg). [30]

To mark the unification of Bavaria and the Electoral Palatinate, both being principal Wittelsbach territories, Elector Maximilian IV Joseph was crowned king of Bavaria. King Maximilian Joseph was quick to change the coat of arms. The various heraldic symbols were replaced and a classical Wittelsbach pattern introduced. The white and blue lozenges symbolized the unity of the territories within the Bavarian kingdom. [31]

The new state also comprised the Duchy of Jülich and Berg as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate. [32]

## Kingdom of Bavaria

When the Holy Roman Empire dissolved under Napoleon's onslaught, Bavaria became a kingdom in 1806 and joined the Confederation of the Rhine. [33]

The Duchy of Jülich was ceded to France and the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the Grand Duchy of Baden. The Duchy of Berg was given to Joachim Murat. The County of Tyrol and the federal state of Salzburg were temporarily annexed with Bavaria but eventually ceded to Austria at the Congress of Vienna. In return, Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of Palatinate to the west of the Rhine and Franconia in 1815.

Between  1799  and  1817,  the  leading  minister,  Count  Montgelas,  followed  a  strict  policy  of modernization  copying  Napoleonic  France;  he  laid  the  foundations  of  centralized  administrative structures  that  survived  the  monarchy  and,  in  part,  have  retained  core  validity  through  to  the  21st century. In May 1808, a first constitution was passed by Maximilian I, [34] being modernized in 1818. This  second  version  established  a  bicameral  Parliament  with  a  House  of  Lords  ( Kammer  der Reichsräte ) and a House of Commons ( Kammer der Abgeordneten ). That constitution was followed until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of World War I.

After the rise of Prussia in the early 18th century, Bavaria preserved its independence by playing off the rivalry of Prussia and Austria. Allied to Austria, it was defeated along with Austria in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War and was not incorporated into the North German Confederation of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When France declared war on Prussia in 1870, all the south German states (Baden, Württemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria) aside from Austria, joined the Prussian forces and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed Deutsches Reich (German Empire) in 1871.

Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and retained some special rights within the federation (such as railways and postal services and control of its army in peace times).

## Part of the German Empire

When  Bavaria  became  part  of  the  newly  formed  German  Empire,  this  action  was  considered controversial  by  Bavarian  nationalists  who  had  wanted  to  retain  independence  from  the  rest  of Germany, as had Austria.

As  Bavaria  had  a  heavily  Catholic  majority  population,  many  people  resented  being  ruled  by  the mostly  Protestant  northerners  in  Prussia. As  a  direct  result  of  the  Bavarian-Prussian  feud,  political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence. [35]

In the early 20th century, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Henrik Ibsen, and other artists were drawn to Bavaria, especially to the Schwabing district in Munich, a center of international artistic activity at the time.

## Free State of Bavaria

World War I led to the abolition of monarchy all over Germany in 1918. The Bavarian monarchy was the first  to  fall  when  on  8  November 1918 Socialist politician Kurt Eisner proclaimed the People's State of Bavaria.  Eisner  headed  a  new,  republican  government  as  minister-president.  On  12 November,  King  Ludwig  III  signed  the Anif  declaration,  releasing  both  civil  and  military  officers from their oaths, [36] which the Eisner government interpreted as an abdication. [37]

After losing the January 1919 elections, Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the Freikorps, the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The Bamberg Constitution ( Bamberger Verfassung ) was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919, placing the Free State of Bavaria inside the Weimar Republic.

Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch led by the Nazis, and Munich and  Nuremberg  became  seen  as  strongholds  of  Nazism  during  the  Weimar  Republic  and  Nazi dictatorship. However, in the crucial German federal election, March 1933, the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.

As a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during World War II and was occupied by United  States  Armed  Forces,  becoming  a  major  part  of  the  American  Zone  of  Allied-occupied Germany, which lasted from 1945 to 1947, and then of Bizone.

The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state Rhineland-

Palatinate. In 1949, Bavaria became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, despite the Bavarian Parliament voting against adopting the Basic Law of Germany, mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual states ( Länder ), but at the same time declared that it would accept it if two-thirds of the other Länder ratified it. All of the other states ratified it, so it became law. [38] Thus, during the Cold War, Bavaria was part of West Germany.

## Bavarian identity

Bavarians have often emphasized a separate national identity and considered themselves as "Bavarians" first, "Germans" second. [39] In the 19thcentury sense, an independent Kingdom of Bavaria existed from only 1806 to 1871. A separate Bavarian identity was emphasized more strongly when Bavaria joined the Prussia-dominated German Empire in 1871, while the Bavarian nationalists wanted to keep Bavaria as Catholic and an independent state. Aside from the minority Bavaria Party, most Bavarians now accept Bavaria as part of Germany. [40]

Another consideration is that Bavaria is not culturally uniform. While inhabitants of Altbayern ("Old Bavaria"), the regions forming the historic Bavaria  before  further  acquisitions  in  1806-1815,  speak  a  Bavarian  dialect  of  German,  Franconia  in  the  north  and  Bavarian  Swabia  in  the southwest, have a distinct culture, including different dialects of German, East Franconian and Swabian, respectively.

In  2025,  four  palaces  of  King  Ludwig  II  of  Bavaria  were  designated  as  world  heritage  sites  by  UNESCO,  for  their  cultural  significance  of outstanding residential architecture.

## Flags and coat of arms

## Flags

Uniquely among German states, Bavaria has two official flags of equal status, one with a white and blue stripe, the other with white and blue diamond-shaped lozenges. Either may be used by civilians and government offices, who are free to choose between them. [41] Unofficial versions of the flag, especially a lozenge style with coat of arms, are sometimes used by civilians.

## Coat of arms

The modern coat of arms of Bavaria was designed by Eduard Ege in 1946, following heraldic traditions.

- The Golden Lion: At the dexter chief, sable, a lion rampant Or, armed and langued gules. This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate.
- The "Franconian Rake": At the sinister chief, per fess dancetty, gules, and argent. This represents the administrative regions of Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia.
- The Blue "Pantier" (mythical creature from French heraldry, sporting a flame instead of a tongue): At the dexter base, argent, a Pantier rampant azure, armed Or and langued gules. This represents the regions of Lower and Upper Bavaria.
- The Three Lions: At the sinister base, Or, three lions passant guardant sable, armed and langued gules. This represents Swabia.
- The White-And-Blue inescutcheon: The inescutcheon of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the House of Wittelsbach. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the People's Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms.
- The People's Crown ( Volkskrone ): The coat of arms is surmounted by a crown with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of the people after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.

## Geography

Bavaria shares international borders with Austria (Salzburg, Tyrol, Upper Austria and Vorarlberg) and the Czech Republic (Karlovy Vary, Plzeň and South Bohemian Regions), as well as with Switzerland (across Lake Constance to the Canton of St. Gallen).

Neighboring  states  within  Germany  are  Baden-Württemberg,  Hesse,  Thuringia,  and  Saxony.  Two major rivers flow through the state: the Danube ( Donau ) and the Main. The Bavarian Forest and the Bohemian Forest form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czech Republic and Bohemia.

The geographic center of the European Union is located in the northwestern corner of Bavaria. [42]

## Climate

At lower elevations the climate is classified according to Köppen's guide as "Cfb" or "Dfb". At higher altitudes the climate becomes "Dfc" and "ET".

The summer months have been getting hotter in recent years. [43] For  example,  June  2019  was  the warmest June in Bavaria since weather observations have been recorded [43] and the winter 2019/2020

was 3 degrees Celsius warmer than the average temperature for many years all over Bavaria. On 20 December 2019 a record temperature of 20.2 °C (68.4 °F) was recorded in Piding. [44] In general winter months are seeing more precipitation which is taking the form of rain more often than that of snow compared to the past. [43] Extreme weather like the 2013 European floods or the 2019 European heavy snowfalls is occurring more and more often. One effect of the continuing warming is the melting of almost all Bavarian Alpine glaciers: Of the five glaciers of Bavaria only the Höllentalferner is predicted to exist over a longer time perspective. The Südliche Schneeferner has almost vanished since the 1980s. [43]

## Administrative regions

Bavaria is divided into seven administrative regions called Regierungsbezirke (singular Regierungsbezirk ).  Each  of  these  regions  has  a  state  agency  called  the Bezirksregierung (district government).

- Altbayern :
- 1. Upper Palatinate ( German: Oberpfalz )
- 2. Upper Bavaria ( Oberbayern )
- 3. Lower Bavaria ( Niederbayern )
- Franconia :
- 1. Upper Franconia ( Oberfranken )
- 2. Middle Franconia ( Mittelfranken )
- 3. Lower Franconia ( Unterfranken )
- Swabia :
- 1. Swabia ( Schwaben )

## Bezirke

Bezirke (regional districts) are the third communal layer in Bavaria; the others are the Landkreise and the Gemeinden or Städte . The Bezirke in Bavaria are territorially identical with the Regierungsbezirke , but they are self-governing regional corporation, having their own parliaments. In the other larger states of Germany, there are only Regierungsbezirke as administrative divisions and no self-governing entities at the level of the Regierungsbezirke as the Bezirke in Bavaria.

## Districts

The second communal layer is made up of 71 rural districts (called Landkreise , singular Landkreis ) that are comparable to counties, as well as the 25 independent cities ( Kreisfreie Städte , singular Kreisfreie Stadt ), both of which share the same administrative responsibilities.

## Politics

Bavaria has a multiparty system dominated by the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), which has won every election since 1945 with the exception of the 1950 ballot. Other important parties are the  Free  V oters,  which  became  the  second  largest  party  in  the  2023  Bavarian  state  election,  The Greens, which became the second biggest political party in the 2018 Bavarian state elections, and the center-left  Social  Democrats  (SPD),  who  had  dominated  the  city  of  Munich  until  2020.  Hitherto, Wilhelm  Hoegner  has  been  the  only  SPD  candidate  to  ever  become  Minister-President;  notable successors in office include multi-term Federal Minister Franz Josef Strauss, a key figure among West German conservatives during the Cold War years, and Edmund Stoiber, who both failed with their bids for Chancellorship.

The German Greens and the center-right Free Voters have been represented in the state parliament since 1986 and 2008 respectively.

In the 2003 elections the CSU won a two-thirds supermajority - something no party had ever achieved in postwar Germany. However, in the subsequent 2008 elections the CSU lost the absolute majority for the first time in 46 years. [48]

The losses were partly attributed by some to the CSU's stance for an anti-smoking bill. (A first anti-smoking law had been proposed by the CSU and passed but was watered down after the election, after which a referendum enforced a strict antismoking bill with a large majority).

## Current Landtag

The last state elections were held on 8 October 2023. The CSU could almost maintain the results from the last elections with 37%. The Greens lost 3% compared to the last election with a result of 14.4%. The SPD lost again compared to the last election and was now at 8.4%. The liberals of  the  FDP  were  not  able  to  reach  the  five-percent-threshold  thus  they  are  not  part  of  the Landtag anymore,  the  second  time  after  the  2013 elections. The right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained another 4% with 14.6% of the vote. [49]

The center-right Free Voters party gained 15.8% of the votes and for the second time formed a government coalition with the CSU which led to the subsequent reelection of Markus Söder as Minister-President of Bavaria. [50]

## Government

The Constitution of Bavaria of the Free State of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.

Bavaria has a unicameral Landtag (English: State Parliament), elected by universal suffrage. [51] Until December  1999,  there  was  also  a Senat ,  or  Senate,  whose  members  were  chosen  by  social  and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished. [52]

The Bavarian State Government consists of the Minister-President of Bavaria, eleven Ministers and six  Secretaries  of  State.  The  Minister-President  is  elected  for  a  period  of  five  years  by  the  State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:

Political processes also take place in the seven regions ( Regierungsbezirke or Bezirke ) in Bavaria, in the 71 rural districts ( Landkreise ) and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts ( kreisfreie Städte ), and in the 2,031 local authorities ( Gemeinden ).

In 1995 Bavaria introduced direct democracy on the local level in a referendum. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called Mehr Demokratie (English:  More  Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court tightened the regulations considerably (including by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs-835 referendums took place from 1995 through 2005.

## Designation as a "free state"

Unlike  most  German  states  ( Länder ),  which  simply  designate  themselves  as  "State  of"  ( Land [...] ),  Bavaria  uses  the  style  of  "Free  State  of Bavaria" ( Freistaat Bayern ). The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between "States" and "Free States". The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where some states use the style "Commonwealth" rather than "State". The term "Free State", a creation of the 19th century and intended to be a German alternative to (or translation of) the Latin-derived republic, was common among the states of the Weimar Republic, after German monarchies had been abolished. Unlike most other states - many of  which  were  new  creations  -  Bavaria  has  resumed  this  terminology  after World War  II. Two  other  states,  Saxony  and Thuringia,  also  call themselves "Free States".

## Arbitrary arrest and human rights

In  July  2017,  Bavaria's  parliament enacted a new revision of the "Gefährdergesetz", allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term,  renewable  indefinitely,  when  they  have  not  committed  a  crime  but  it  is  assumed  that  they  might  commit  a  crime  "in  the  near future". [54] Critics like the prominent journalist Heribert Prantl have called the law "shameful" and compared it to Guantanamo Bay detention camp, [55] assessed it to be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, [56] and also compared it to the legal situation in Russia, where a similar law allows for imprisonment for a maximum term of two years (i.e., not indefinitely). [57]

## Economy

Bavaria  has  one  of  the  largest  economies  in  Germany  and  Europe  as  a  whole, [58] having  a  GDP  of €768.469  billion  ($790.813  billion)  in  2023,  the  second  highest  of  the  16  German  states,  only  behind North Rhine-Westphalia which had a GDP of €839.074 billion ($863.6 billion) in 2023. [59][60] Bavaria had a GDP per capita of €53,768 ($56,456) in 2022, giving it the third highest GDP per capita behind Bremen in second and Hamburg in first. [61] One of Bavaria's largest industries is the automotive industry, with  Bavaria  having  four  BMW  and  two  Audi  manufacturing  plants  and  the  headquarters  of  both companies. Bavaria has the second-most employees (207,829) in the automotive industry of all German states after Baden-Württemberg as of 2018. [62] Other countries such as Czechia, Austria, Switzerland and Italy have strong economic ties with Bavaria. [63]

Bavaria also is home to the headquarters of commercial vehicle manufacturer MAN and aircraft engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines. Many other global companies such as Adidas, Siemens, and Allianz also have headquarters in Bavarian cities and towns. [64] Several  American  companies  have  set  up  research  and  development facilities  in  Bavaria  such  as  Apple,  Google,  IBM,  Intel,  Texas  Instruments  and Coherent. [65] Despite  being  hundreds  of  miles  from  the  sea,  companies  such  as Bavaria Yachtbau produce sailing yachts and motorboats. [66]

Bavaria is the most visited state in Germany, as over 38.86 million tourists visited Bavaria in 2023 alone, significantly higher than North RhineWestphalia's 23.58 million tourists. [67] In 2019, tourism brought in a gross value of €28.1 billion ($28.918 billion), making up 4.9% of Bavaria's economy. [68] Some  significant  tourist  destinations  include  the  Bavarian  National  Museum,  Margravial  Opera  House,  Deutsches  Museum, Christmas  markets  in  Nuremberg  and  Munich  and  the  annually  held  Oktoberfest  event,  which  made  €1.2  billion  ($1.236  billion)  in  2018 alone. [69]

The unemployment rate stood at 2.9% in October 2018, the lowest in Germany and one of the lowest in the European Union. [70]

## Demographics

Bavaria has a population of approximately 13.1 million inhabitants (2020). Eight of the 80 largest cities in Germany are located within Bavaria with Munich being the largest (1,484,226 inhabitants, approximately 6.1 million when including the broader metropolitan area), followed by Nuremberg (518,370 inhabitants, approximately 3.6 million when including the broader metropolitan area), Augsburg (296,582 inhabitants) and Regensburg (153,094 inhabitants). All other cities in Bavaria had less than 150,000 inhabitants each in 2020. Population density in Bavaria was 186/km 2 (480/sq  mi),  below  the  national  average  of  233/km 2 (600/sq  mi).  Foreign  nationals  resident  in  Bavaria  (both  immigrants  and refugees/asylum seekers) were principally from other EU countries and Turkey.

## Culture

Some features of the Bavarian culture and mentality are remarkably distinct from the rest of Germany. Noteworthy differences (especially in rural areas, less significant in the major cities) can be found with respect to religion, traditions, and language.

## Religion

<!-- image -->

Bavarian culture ( Altbayern ) has a long and predominant  tradition  of  Roman  Catholic  faith. Pope Benedict XVI (Joseph Alois Ratzinger) was born in Marktl am Inn in Upper Bavaria and was Cardinal-Archbishop of Munich  and  Freising. Otherwise, the culturally Franconian and Swabian regions of the modern  State of Bavaria are historically more diverse in religiosity, with both

Catholic and Protestant traditions. In 1925, 70.0% of the Bavarian population was Catholic, 28.8% was Protestant, 0.7% was Jewish, and 0.5% was placed in other religious categories. [75]

<!-- image -->

As of 2020 46.9% of Bavarians adhered to Catholicism (a decline from 70.4% in 1970). [76][74] 17.2 percent  of  the  population  adheres  to  the  Evangelical  Lutheran  Church  in  Bavaria,  which  has  also

declined since 1970. [76][74] Three percent was Orthodox and Muslims make up 4.0% of the population of Bavaria. 28.9 percent of Bavarians are irreligious or adhere to other religions.

## Traditions

Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as Tracht are worn on special occasions and include in Altbayern Lederhosen for males and Dirndl for females. Centuries-old folk music is performed. The Maibaum, or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's business directory, as figures on the pole represented the trades of the village), and the bagpipes of the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the ancient Celtic and Germanic remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are many traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the Aperschnalzen, competitive whipcracking.

Whether in Bavaria, overseas or with citizens from other nations Bavarians continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their heritage alive.

## Food and drink

Bavarians tend to place a great value on food and drink. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example Weißwurst ("white sausage") or in some instances a variety of entrails.

More than 285 typical Bavarian products have been recorded in the Bavarian specialities database 'GenussBayern (https://www.genusserbe.bayer n.de/index.php)' since the 1990s. Recipes and museums can also be found there. With a total of 54 specialities protected under European law, Bavaria  is  the  No.  1  speciality  region  in  Germany. [77] Bavarian  products  such  as  'Bavarian  beer',  'Nuremberg  bratwurst',  'Allgäu  mountain cheese' and 'Schrobenhausen asparagus' are just as much a part of the official EU list 'eAmbrosia' of prestigious regional culinary specialities as the protected names 'Champagne' and 'Prosciutto di Parma'. [78][79] Bavarian specialities, which are protected as geographical indications, are deeply rooted in their region of origin, important anchors of local identity and also tourist flagships - they are therefore at the heart of Bavarian cuisine.

Restaurants that carry the 'Ausgezeichnete GenussKüche' (https://www.bayerischekueche.de/) award (recognizable by a sign near the door) are known by locals for their certified, authentic Bavarian cuisine. [80]

At  folk  festivals  and  in  many  beer  gardens,  beer  is  traditionally  served  by  the  litre  (in  a Maß ).  Bavarians  are  particularly  proud [81] of  the traditional Reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law, initially established by the Duke of Bavaria for the City of Munich (i.e. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, barley, and hops. In 1906 the Reinheitsgebot made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down in 1987 as incompatible with the European common market. [82] German  breweries,  however,  cling  to  the  principle,  and  Bavarian  breweries  still  comply  with  it  in  order  to  distinguish  their  beer brands. [83] Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most prolific beer drinkers, with an average annual consumption of 130-135 liters per capita, as of 2018. [84]

Bavaria  is  also  home  to  the  Franconia  wine  region,  which  is  situated  along  the  river  Main  in  Franconia.  The  region  has  produced  wine ( Frankenwein ) for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the Bocksbeutel wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.

## Language and dialects

Three  German  dialects  are  most  commonly  spoken  in  Bavaria:  Austro-Bavarian  in  Old  Bavaria (Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, and the Upper Palatinate), Swabian German (an Alemannic German dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (southwest) and East Franconian German in Franconia (north). In the small town Ludwigsstadt in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia, Thuringian dialect is  spoken.  During  the  20th  century  an  increasing  part  of  the  population  began  to  speak  Standard German (Hochdeutsch), mainly in the cities.

## Ethnography

Bavarians consider themselves to be egalitarian and informal. [85] Their sociability can be experienced at the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous beer gardens. In traditional Bavarian beer gardens, patrons may bring their own food but buy beer only from the brewery that runs the beer garden. [86]

## Museums

There  are  around  1,300  museums  in  Bavaria,  including  museums  of  art  and  cultural  history,  castles  and  palaces,  archaeological  and  natural history collections, museums of technological and industrial history, and farm and open-air museums. The history of Bavarian museums dates back to manorial cabinets of curiosities and treasuries. The art holdings of the House of Wittelsbach thus formed the first and essential foundation of later state museums. As early as the mid-16th century, Duke Albrecht V (r. 1550-1579) had collected paintings as well as Greek and Roman sculptures (or copies made of them). He had the Antiquarium in the Munich Residence built specifically for his collection of antique sculptures. The  electors  Maximilian  I  (r.  1594-1651)  and  Max  II.  Emanuel  (r.  1679-1726)  expanded  the  art  collections  considerably.  In  the  Age  of Enlightenment  at  the  end  of  the  18th  century,  there  was  a  demand  to  open  up  art  collections  to  the  general  public  in  the  spirit  of  "popular education".  But  Museums were not founded by the state until the time of the art-loving King Ludwig I (r. 1825-1848). In Munich, he built Glyptothek  (opened  1830), Alte  Pinakothek  (opened  1836),  and  Neue  Pinakothek  (opened  1853). Also,  the  foundation  of  the  Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg (1852), the establishment of the Neue Pinakothek, which opened in 1853, and the Bavarian National Museum (1867) in Munich were of central importance for the development of museums in Bavaria in the 19th century. With the end of the monarchy in

1918, many castles and formerly Wittelsbach property passed to the young Free State. In particular, the castles of king Ludwig II (r. 1864-1886) Neuschwanstein, Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, quickly became  magnets  for  the  public. Since then, the number  of  Bavarian  Museums  has  grown considerably, from 125 in 1907 to around 1,300 today. [87]

Bayern Munich is the most successful football team in Germany having won a record 33 German titles and 6 UEFA Champions League titles. They are followed by 1. FC Nürnberg who have won 9 titles.  SpVgg  Greuther  Fürth  have  won  3  championships  while  TSV  1860  Munich  have  been champions once.
